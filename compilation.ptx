<chapter><title>Compiling a PTX document to HTML and PDF</title>

<introduction>
<p>Now it's the time for the magic to happen!   You will take a sample PTX file (extension <c>ptx</c> or <c>xml</c>) and use it to create an HTML document and a PDF. (XML is a deprecated file type; when you create PTX focuments, your extension should be <c>ptx</c>.)</p>
<p> First, navigate in your Git Bash shell to the folder containing the PTX file you plan to work with.  For our example, navigate to <c>~/mathbook/examples/hello-world</c>, which contains the PTX file <c>hello-world.xml</c>. 
</p>
</introduction>
<section><title>Compiling to HTML</title>
<p>
From the folder containing the PTX file, type <c>~/xsltproc/xsltproc --xinclude ~/mathbook/xsl/mathbook-html.xsl hello-world.xml</c>. This will compile the PTX into an HTML file <c>hello-world.html</c> in the same folder as <c>hello-world.xml</c>.  You can open it by navigating to the folder via the Windows desktop and opening it the way you'd open any HTML document on your machine.</p>
<p>
What was all that stuff in the compilation command?? 
<ul>
<li><p><c>~/xsltproc/xsltproc</c> ran the <c>xsltproc</c> executable, living within the <c>xsltproc</c> folder.</p></li>
<li><p><c>--xinclude</c> is an optional command that is required if you include modular PTX files in your main PTX file; don't worry about what that means for now.  Suffice to say that you can always include that optional command without running into problems, so why not include it by default?</p></li>
<li><p><c>~/mathbook/xsl/mathbook-html.xsl</c> is the style file that makes the PTX compile into HTML, rather than into LaTeX (on the road to becoming a PDF).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, <c>hello-world.xml</c> is the name of the PTX file you're compiling!</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

<note><p>If you don't move your <c>mathbook</c> or <c>xsltproc</c> folders or their contents on your local machine, you can always start off your compilation command with <c>~/xsltproc/xsltproc --xinclude ~/mathbook/xsl/mathbook-html.xsl</c> and simply appending the name of your PTX file,  <alert>as long as you're in the directory containing your PTX file</alert>.</p></note>

<ol>
<li><p>From the directory containing your PTX file, type in the same  command as you used to create the HTML document, replacing the <c>mathbook-html.xsl</c> with <c>mathbook-latex.xsl</c>. That is, enter <c>~/xsltproc/xsltproc --xinclude ~/mathbook/xsl/mathbook-latex.xsl hello-world.xml</c>. This should create a LaTeX file hello-world.latex in the same <c>hello-world</c> folder.  </p></li>
<li><p>Enter the command <c>pdflatex hello-world.latex</c> to create a PDF from the LaTeX file.  <c>hello-world.pdf</c> will appear in the <c>hello-world</c> folder.</p></li></ol>
