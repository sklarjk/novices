<title>Creating your own PTX document</title>

Put here the instructions for creating a new PTX file <c>test.ptx</c>.
Note that Sublime or the like should be used to create/edit PTX docs.
Note that you will need to use linux commands to make sure you are calling xsltproc and pointing to the style and PTX files in the correct locations.

<chapter><title>Including modular source files</title>
<p>
From the subsection <em>Modular Source Files</em> of <xref ref="authorguide">: <q>For a large project, such as a book, you will likely want to split up your source into logical units, such as
chapters and sections. <c>xsltproc</c> supports an include mechanism that makes this possible. Let us suppose
that a section of your book on animals has a chapter on mammals with a section on monkeys. Then you
need to do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For the file containing the <chapter> tag for the chapter on mammals, place the attribute
<c>xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"</c>
on the outermost tag in the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Within the <c><chapter></c> element for the chapter on mammals, add the line <c><xi:include href="monkeys.xml"
/></c> to <q>pull in</q> the section on monkeys at that location. The <c>@href</c> attribute can point to a file in a
subdirectory, but will be interpreted relative to the location of the file containing the mammal chapter
element.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</q>
<p>There is a third step listed in the <xref ref="authorguide">, but we are already including the command <c>--xinclude</c> when we compile our PTX files, so you're now good to go.</p>
