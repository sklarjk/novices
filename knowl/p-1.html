<p>This tutorial will help novice PreTeXt (PTX) users install necessary software on their Windows machine and learn the basics of compiling PTX files into HTML and PDF forms. It will be important to keep the following in mind throughout. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><p>Much of the documentation about PreTeXt (PTX) will refer to it by its previous name, MathBook XML (XML), and many of the example PTX documents found in the <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mathbook</tt> repo (you'll learn what that is in <a href="repos.html" alt="Chapter 3 Cloning and maintaining the mathbook repository on your local machine" title="Chapter 3 Cloning and maintaining the mathbook repository on your local machine">Chapter 3</a>) will have XML extensions.  “XML” is being slowly being migrated to “PTX” in the documentation, but it may take a while since the documentation is extensive!  You can replace, in your mind, XML with PTX anytime it appears.</p></li>
<li><p>We recommend <b><i>NOT</i></b> changing PATH environment variables on Windows unless you absolutely have to.   Which sometimes you do.  But if you see in documentation that changing the PATH variable is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>optional</em>, don't do it.  Many Windows users have a surprising amount of trouble changing PATH variables, through no fault of their own.</p></li>
