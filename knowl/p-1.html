<p>Here we provide a list of the steps you will need to take to get PTX up and running on your local Windows machine.  First, in any order: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>
<p>If you don't already have one you like to use, install a text editor that will produce “unformatted” text.</p>
<p>If you don't know what that means, or don't already have such an editor that you like to use, we recommend installing Sublime Text, which you can download at <a class="external-url" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://www.sublimetext.com/</tt></a>. (You can use the trial version for free indefinitely, but will get regular pop-ups asking you to register; registration costs $70.)</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Why?</em> You will write your PTX source documents using this editor. (For more information on text editors with respect to PTX, see <a knowl="./knowl/authorguide.html" knowl-id="xref-authorguide" alt="Bibliographic Entry 2 MathBook XML Author's Guide" title="Bibliographic Entry 2 MathBook XML Author's Guide">[2]</a>.)</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>installation difficulty level:</em> Easy.</p>

<li>
<p>Install Git by choosing the Windows option at <a class="external-url" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</tt></a>.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Why?</em> From the Introduction in <a knowl="./knowl/gitforauthors.html" knowl-id="xref-gitforauthors" alt="Bibliographic Entry 1 Git for Authors" title="Bibliographic Entry 1 Git for Authors">[1]</a>: “Git \(\ldots\) is a revision control system. What's that? It is a tool to record changes to software, a tool to experiment with changes to software, and a tool to collaborate creating software.”</p>
<p>For more details on why you'll be using Git (and how to use it!), see <a knowl="./knowl/gitforauthors.html" knowl-id="xref-gitforauthors" alt="Bibliographic Entry 1 Git for Authors" title="Bibliographic Entry 1 Git for Authors">[1]</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>You will perform all of your compilations in the Git Bash shell</i></b>, which is installed when you install Git.  You don't need to know what it is, exactly, other than that it is a command-line interface in which you'll enter your commands. If you've used Unix or Linux, you're in your wheelhouse in the Git Bash shell.  If you haven't, don't worry; we'll cover the basics of what you need to know.</p>

<li>
<p>Sign up for a GitHub account at <a class="external-url" href="https://github.com" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://github.com</tt></a>.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Why?</em> GitHub is a code hosting platform. We will later elaborate on how we will use GitHub.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>installation difficulty level:</em> Easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc</tt>.</p>
<p>We highly recommend doing this installation as described in the great Windows <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Getting Started</em> video at <a class="external-url" href="http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/documentation.html#getting-started-videos" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/documentation.html#getting-started-videos</tt></a> created by Karl-Dieter Crisman.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Why?</em> <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc</tt> is a command line tool for applying XSLT stylesheets to XML documents. You don't need to worry about what this means, but you do need to have the tool installed.</p>
<p><b><i>Do not move this folder or its contents.</i></b></p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Installation difficulty level:</em> Straighforward if you follow the video instructions.</p>
