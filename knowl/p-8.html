<li>
<p>Install a text editor.</p>
<p>If you don't already have one installed that you like to use, you will need to install a text editor that will produce “unformatted” text.</p>
<p>If you don't know what that means, or don't already have such an editor that you like, we recommend installing Sublime Text, which you can download at <a class="external-url" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://www.sublimetext.com/</tt></a>. (You can use the trial version for free indefinitely, but will get regular pop-ups asking you to register; registration costs $70.)</p>
<p>For more extensive information about text editors you may use with PTX, see Appendix B in <a knowl="./knowl/authorguide.html" knowl-id="xref-authorguide" alt="Bibliographic Entry 2 MathBook XML Author's Guide" title="Bibliographic Entry 2 MathBook XML Author's Guide">[2]</a>.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Why this installation?</em> You will write your PTX source documents using this editor.</p>

<li>
<p>Install Git and create a shortcut to the Git Bash shell.</p>
<p></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
<p>Install Git by choosing the Windows option at <a class="external-url" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</tt></a> and selecting the default options.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Why this installation?</em> From the Introduction in <a knowl="./knowl/gitforauthors.html" knowl-id="xref-gitforauthors" alt="Bibliographic Entry 1 Git for Authors" title="Bibliographic Entry 1 Git for Authors">[1]</a>: “Git \(\ldots\) is a revision control system. What's that? It is a tool to record changes to software, a tool to experiment with changes to software, and a tool to collaborate creating software.”</p>
<p>For more details on why you'll be using Git (and how to use it!), see <a knowl="./knowl/gitforauthors.html" knowl-id="xref-gitforauthors" alt="Bibliographic Entry 1 Git for Authors" title="Bibliographic Entry 1 Git for Authors">[1]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a shortcut to the file <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git-bash.exe</tt>.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Why this shortcut creation?</em> <b><i>You will perform all of your compilations in the Git Bash shell</i></b>, which is installed when you install Git.  You don't need to know what it is, exactly, other than that it is a command-line interface in which you'll enter your commands. If you've used Unix or Linux, you're in your wheelhouse in the Git Bash shell.  If you haven't, don't worry; we'll cover the basics of what you need to know.</p>

<p>If you plan to create PDFs from your PTX files, you will need to have a LaTeX compiler installed. (If you only plan to create HTML files, you may skip this step.)</p>
<p>If you don't already have one, one option is MiKTeX, which you can download from <a class="external-url" href="https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex</tt></a>. Simply choose the default options when installing, as long as by default it installs into a folder whose path name (e.g., <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Programs/MiKTeX/</tt>) contains no spaces.  (Spaces in path names can cause problems, and should be avoided as much as possible.) If the default path name contains spaces,  change the installation location to one that doesn't contain spaces.</p>
<p>If you choose another LaTeX compiler, make sure it includes the executable files <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xetex.exe</tt> and <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pdflatex.exe</tt>, and again, make sure to install it in a location that avoids spaces in its path name.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Why this installation?</em> We can compile our PTX files to LaTeX files using <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc</tt> (see <a knowl="./knowl/xslt.html" knowl-id="xref-xslt" alt="Item 5 " title="Item 5 ">Step 5</a>), but we must then use a LaTeX compiler to compile the LaTeX files to PDFs.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Installation difficulty level:</em> Easy, other than ensuring installation paths don't contain spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc</tt>.</p>
<p>Follow the  instructions for installing <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc</tt> <b><i>exactly</i></b> as described in the Karl-Dieter Crisman's Windows <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Getting Started</em> video found at <a class="external-url" href="http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/documentation.html#getting-started-videos" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/documentation.html#getting-started-videos</tt></a>.  The installation files are at <a class="external-url" href="https://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html" target="_blank"><tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html</tt></a> and the discussion of the installation of <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc</tt> begins in the video at 3:31. We elaborate on some of the video instructions below.</p>
<p></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><p>A description of the exact files you will need to download from the website are found in Lists E.2.1 and E.2.2 in Appendix E of <a knowl="./knowl/authorguide.html" knowl-id="xref-authorguide" alt="Bibliographic Entry 2 MathBook XML Author's Guide" title="Bibliographic Entry 2 MathBook XML Author's Guide">[2]</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<p><b><i>It is essential that you install the <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc</tt> files in your default Git Bash directory in order for you to avoid making adjustments to later commands.</i></b></p>
<p>To find what that directory is, open the Git Bash shell using the shortcut on your desktop, and enter <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pwd</tt>.  This will likely yield <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">c/users/username</tt>, where <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">username</tt> is the profile under which you're logged into your Windows machine. In any case, <b><i>this is your default Git Bash directory</i></b>. You will need to move all the files you extract, as per the video instructions, into this directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b><i>Do not move the <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc</tt> folder or its contents from their initial locations, and do not change the PATH environment variable name, despite this option being described in E.2.2 in <a knowl="./knowl/authorguide.html" knowl-id="xref-authorguide" alt="Bibliographic Entry 2 MathBook XML Author's Guide" title="Bibliographic Entry 2 MathBook XML Author's Guide">[2]</a>.</i></b></p></li>
</ul>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Why this installation?</em> <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc</tt> is a command line tool for applying XSLT stylesheets to XML documents. You don't need to worry about what this means, but you do need to have the tool installed.</p>
<p><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Installation difficulty level:</em> Moderate. (Potentially-difficult-to-hair-pulling if you try to change the PATH variable name.) Carefully follow the video instructions.</p>
