<p>Don't know what this means?  That's ok!  A GitHub repository (or “repo”) is basically a collection of files hosted on GitHub, and what you need to know for now is that you're  essentially copying onto your local computer a GitHub repo in a way that will allow you to later easily update the files on your local machine in accordance with their updates in the corresponding GitHub repo.  Some of these files you don't “need” (e.g., the library of examples), but some you do (e.g., the files <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mathbook-html.xsl</tt> and <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mathbook-latex.xsl</tt>), and you will need to update these from GitHub from time to time, so you should follow these instructions exactly.</p>
