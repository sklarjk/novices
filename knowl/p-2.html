<p>Much of the documentation about PreTeXt (PTX) will refer to it by its previous name, MathBook XML (XML), and many of the example PTX documents found in the <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mathbook</tt> repo (you'll learn what that is in <a href="repos.html" alt="Chapter 3 Cloning and maintaining the mathbook repository on your local machine" title="Chapter 3 Cloning and maintaining the mathbook repository on your local machine">Chapter 3</a>) will have XML extensions.  “XML” is being slowly being migrated to “PTX” in the documentation, but it may take a while since the documentation is extensive!  You can replace, in your mind, XML with PTX anytime it appears.</p>
