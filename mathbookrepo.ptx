<chapter><title>Cloning and maintaining the <c>mathbook</c> repository on your local machine</title>

<p>
Don't know what this means?  That's ok!  A GitHub repository (or <q>repo</q>) is basically a collection of files hosted on GitHub, and what you need to know for now is that you're  essentially copying onto your local computer a GitHub repo in a way that will allow you to later easily update the files on your local machine in accordance with their updates in the corresponding GitHub repo.  Some of these files you don't <q>need</q> (e.g., the library of examples), but some you do (e.g., the files <c>mathbook-html.xsl</c> and <c>mathbook-latex.xsl</c>), and you will need to update these from GitHub from time to time, so you should follow these instructions exactly.</p>

<p>
<ol><li><p><em>Cloning the <c>mathbook</c> repository</em></p>

<p>In your Git Bash shell, enter in the following commands, one at a time:</p>

<p><tabular>
  <row>
  <cell><c>git clone https://github.com/rbeezer/mathbook.git</c></cell>
</row>
<row><cell>
<c>cd mathbook</c></cell></row>
<row><cell>
  <c>git checkout dev</c></cell>
</row>
</tabular></p>

<p>This will install a folder called <c>mathbook</c> on your local machine that contains the necessary (and optional) files.  <alert>Do not move this folder or its contents.</alert> </p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Keeping the <c>mathbook</c> repository on your local machine up to date</em></p>

<p>Whenever the developers make changes to the files in the GitHub repository <c>mathbook</c>, you can update these files accordingly 
on your local machine by navigating in the Git Bash shell to the <c>mathbook</c> folder and entering the command <c>git pull</c>.</p>
