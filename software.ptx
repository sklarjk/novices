<title>Software Installations and  GitHub account setup</title>

<p>Here we provide a list of the steps you will need to take to get PTX up and running on your local Windows machine.  (You can find  more extensive documentation for this in Sections E.1<ndash/>E.3 in Dave Rosoff's invaluable <em>Windows Installation Notes</em> in <xref ref="authorguide" />, though we recommend <alert>avoiding performing the  task described in Section E.2.2</alert>; see  <xref ref="xslt"> Step</xref> below.)</p>

<p><alert>You may perform most of the installations in any order, but should perform <xref ref="xslt">Step</xref> after <xref ref="git">Step</xref>.</alert></p>
<p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install a text editor.</p>
<p>
	If you don't already have one installed that you like to use, you will need to install a text editor that will produce <q>unformatted</q> text.</p>
<p> If you don't know what that means, or don't
already have such an editor that you like, we recommend installing Sublime Text, which you can download at <url href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"/>. (You can use the trial version for free indefinitely, but will get regular pop-ups asking you to register; registration costs $70.) </p>

<p>For more extensive information about text editors you may use with PTX, see Appendix B in <xref ref="authorguide"/>.</p>

<p><em>Why this installation?</em> You will write your PTX source documents using this editor. </p>
<p><em>Installation difficulty level:</em> Easy.</p>

</li>

<li xml:id="git"><p>Install Git and create a shortcut to the Git Bash shell.</p>
<p>

	<ol><li><p>Install Git by choosing the Windows option at <url href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"/> and selecting the default options. </p>

<p><em>Why this installation?</em> From the Introduction in <xref ref="gitforauthors"/>: <q>Git <m>\ldots</m> is a revision control system. What's that? It is a tool to record changes to software, a tool to experiment with changes to software, and a tool to collaborate creating software.</q></p><p>For more details on why you'll be using Git (and how to use it!), see <xref ref="gitforauthors"/>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>
	 Create a shortcut to the file <c>git-bash.exe</c>.</p>
<p>
<em>Why this shortcut creation?</em> <alert>You will perform all of your compilations in the Git Bash shell</alert>, which is installed when you install Git.  You don't need to know what it is, exactly, other than that it is a command-line interface in which you'll enter your commands. If you've used Unix or Linux, you're in your wheelhouse in the Git Bash shell.  If you haven't, don't worry; we'll cover the basics of what you need to know.</p></li></ol></p>

<p></p>
<p><em>Installation and shortcut creation difficulty level:</em> Easy.</p></li>

<li><p>Sign up for a GitHub account at <url href="https://github.com"/>.</p>

<p><em>Why sign up for this account?</em> GitHub is a code hosting platform. We will later elaborate on how we will use GitHub.</p>
<p><em>Sign-up  difficulty level:</em> Easy.</p>
</li>



<li>
<p>If you plan to create PDFs from your PTX files, you will need to have a LaTeX compiler installed. (If you only plan to create HTML files, you may skip this step.) </p>


<p>If you don't already have one, one option is MiKTeX, which you can download from <url href="https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex"/>. Simply choose the default options when installing, as long as by default it installs into a folder whose path name (e.g., <c>C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Programs/MiKTeX/</c>) contains no spaces.  (Spaces in path names can cause problems, and should be avoided as much as possible.) If the default path name contains spaces,  change the installation location to one that doesn't contain spaces.</p>




<p>If you choose another LaTeX compiler, make sure it includes the executable files <c>xetex.exe</c> and <c>pdflatex.exe</c>, and again, make sure to install it in a location that avoids spaces in its path name.</p>

<p><em>Why this installation?</em> We can compile our PTX files to LaTeX files using <c>xsltproc</c> (see <xref ref="xslt">Step</xref>), but we must then use a LaTeX compiler to compile the LaTeX files to PDFs.</p>



<p><em>Installation difficulty level:</em> Easy, other than ensuring installation paths don't contain spaces.</p>

</li>
<li xml:id="xslt"><p>Install <c>xsltproc</c>.</p>

<p>Follow the  instructions for installing <c>xsltproc</c> <alert>exactly</alert> as described in the Karl-Dieter Crisman's Windows <em>Getting Started</em> video found at <url href="http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/documentation.html#getting-started-videos"/>.  The installation files are at <url href="https://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html"/> and the discussion of the installation of <c>xsltproc</c> begins in the video at 3:31. We elaborate on some of the video instructions below.

<ul>
<li>
<p>A description of the 
 exact files you will need to download from the website are found in Lists E.2.1 and E.2.2 in Appendix E of <xref ref="authorguide"/>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<alert>It is essential that you install the <c>xsltproc</c> files in your default Git Bash directory in order for you to avoid making adjustments to later commands.</alert>
</p>
<p>To find what that directory is, open the Git Bash shell using the shortcut on your desktop, and enter <c>pwd</c>.  This will likely yield <c>c/users/username</c>, where <c>username</c> is the profile under which you're logged into your Windows machine. In any case, <alert>this is your default Git Bash directory</alert>. You will need to move all the files you extract, as per the video instructions, into this directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><alert>Do not move the <c>xsltproc</c> folder or its contents from their initial locations, and do not change the PATH environment variable name, despite this option being described in E.2.2 in <xref ref="authorguide"/>.</alert> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><em>Why this installation?</em> <c>xsltproc</c> is a command line tool for applying XSLT stylesheets to XML documents. You don't need to worry about what this means, but you do need to have the tool installed. </p> 


<p><em>Installation difficulty level:</em> Moderate. (Potentially-difficult-to-hair-pulling if you try to change the PATH variable name.) Carefully follow the video instructions.</p></li></ol></p>
